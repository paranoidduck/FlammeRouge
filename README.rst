How to play
-----------

You are the **grey** (gris) player. Your team competes against three other
ones: the blue (bleu) one, the green (vert) one and the black (noir) one.

Each team is composed of a Sprinter (sprinteur) and a Runner (rouleur), so
that each member of a team is show as a digram. For example, 'Rb' stands for
the blue Runner, 'Sg' for the grey Sprinter, and so on.

The first team to reach the 73rd block ends the race!

For more information, read the `rules`_ of the board game.
